# pulsar_software_installation
Bash script to install tempo/tempo2/psrchive.

Use at great peril to : your sanity, the risks of your computer burning down and/or years of research being dangerously risked.
Honestly though, psrchive and tempo/tempo2 do not follow well explained packaging guidelines, so these are simply a set of installation instructions compiled from folk-lore. They *may not* always work and in particular, you should pay carefull attention to the error messages and warnings that the respective *make* commands throw. This will probably save you years of frustratingly banging on the keys in the desperate hope that hitting them harder will magically solve that weird issue and/or an abrupt descent into trichotillomania.
